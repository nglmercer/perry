# Committed runner for the Perry "gap" suite.
#
# Every test-files/test_gap_*.ts is AOT-compiled by Perry and diffed
# byte-for-byte against `node --experimental-strip-types`. This is a thin
# wrapper over run_parity_tests.sh --filter test_gap_ so it reuses the ONE
# canonical normalizer, the skip-list, the per-test output cap, and the JSON
# report (this shared-normalizer reuse is the seed of roadmap initiative I-14).
#
# Replaces the out-of-repo /tmp/run_gap_tests.sh that CLAUDE.md used to point
# at — the gap suite is the highest-signal-per-second test Perry has and was
# previously dark in CI.
#
# Regression-gate semantics: exits non-zero if any gap test fails parity or
# compilation and is NOT already triaged in test-parity/known_failures.json.
# (run_parity_tests.sh's own exit code only trips below 80% AGGREGATE parity,
# which is far too loose to catch a single-feature regression — exactly the
# "a module silently went to 0 behind a green build" class.)
#
# Requirements:
#   - a Rust toolchain (the wrapped run_parity_tests.sh builds target/release/perry)
#   - node with --experimental-strip-types
#   - jq
#
# Usage: scripts/run_gap_tests.sh
