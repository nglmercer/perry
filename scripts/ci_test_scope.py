"""Compute which workspace packages a CI `cargo test` run must cover.

Reads the changed file paths (one per line) on stdin and prints the set of
workspace packages to test, one per line, so the per-PR `cargo-test` gate only
exercises crates the diff can actually affect instead of the whole workspace
(~90 min). The release-tag and nightly runs pass `--full` to test everything.

Selection rules:
  * A file under `crates/<dir>/...` selects that crate AND every workspace crate
    that (transitively) depends on it — a reverse-dependency closure, so a change
    to a foundational crate (perry-runtime, perry-hir, …) still fans out to its
    dependents.
  * Infra changes (`.github/`, `scripts/`, `rust-toolchain*`) or any unrecognized
    top-level path force the FULL workspace (conservative — unknown blast radius).
  * Metadata-only changes (`CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, any `*.md`, `docs/`, the
    root `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`) select nothing — a version-bump / changelog
    PR runs no tests and is instantly green.
  * `--full` (release tags, nightly cron, workflow_dispatch) selects every
    testable workspace member.

Cross-host UI crates and doc fixtures that don't build on the Linux CI image are
always excluded (mirrors the historical exclude list in test.yml). `perry-runtime`
is included when affected; the workflow runs it single-threaded separately.
