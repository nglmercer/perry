# Native bindings — overview

Perry compiles TypeScript to native executables. When user code says
`import { createConnection } from "mysql2"`, the call doesn't bottom out
in JavaScript-engine glue — it lands on a Rust function that's been
linked into the binary as `extern "C"`. This page is the map of how
that works end-to-end.

## The big picture

There are four layers, from most stable to most flexible:

│  Layer 4: User TypeScript                                        │

│    const c = await createConnection({ host, user, password });    │
│    const [rows] = await c.query("SELECT 1");                      │

│         `bun add @scope/<name>`. Wins over (b) and (c).           │
│                                                                   │

```

The whole point: **anyone can publish a binding**. A third-party crate
ships an npm package containing a Rust crate, a `package.json` with a
`perry.nativeLibrary` block, and prebuilt staticlibs. Users
`bun add` it. Perry's compiler picks it up automatically. No PR to the
Perry repo, no central registry approval, no `@perryts/` namespace
required.

## Worked example: `import { createConnection } from "mysql2"`

Step by step, what happens when you `perry compile` a program with
that import:

### 1. Module resolution

Perry's resolver
([`crates/perry/src/commands/compile/resolve.rs`](https://github.com/PerryTS/perry/blob/main/crates/perry/src/commands/compile/resolve.rs))
walks each search path looking for `node_modules/mysql2/`:

- **If `node_modules/mysql2/package.json` exists with a
  `perry.nativeLibrary` block**: parse the manifest, treat the package
  as a native binding. Skip layers (c) and (d).
- **If `node_modules/mysql2/` exists without a
  `perry.nativeLibrary` block**: this is a JS-only npm package; fall
  through to the V8 / JS interpretation path (separate compilation
  flow).
- **If `node_modules/mysql2/` doesn't exist at all**: consult the
  **well-known table** at
  [`crates/perry/well_known_bindings.toml`](https://github.com/PerryTS/perry/blob/main/crates/perry/well_known_bindings.toml).
  The table maps `mysql2` → `perry-ext-mysql2` (a Rust crate that
  ships in the Perry install). The user didn't `npm install` anything;
  Perry handles it.
- **If nothing matches**: compile error pointing at the import line.

### 2. ABI version check

If the resolved binding has a `perry.nativeLibrary.abiVersion` field
(required from v0.6.0 onwards; warning-only in v0.5.x), Perry verifies
the declared semver range covers the bundled `perry-ffi` version. A
binding declaring `"0.5"` loads under any `0.5.x` Perry; one declaring
`"^1.0"` loads only under `1.x`. Mismatches are a hard compile error
with a recipe pointing at the offending package.

See [`manifest-v1.md`](manifest-v1.md) for the full schema.

### 3. Symbol mapping

The manifest's `functions[]` block lists every `extern "C"` symbol
the staticlib exports plus their TypeScript-visible signature:

```json
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "js_mysql2_create_connection",
      "params": ["jsvalue"],
      "returns": "promise"
    },
    {
      "name": "js_mysql2_connection_query",
      "params": ["i64", "string", "jsvalue"],
      "returns": "promise"
    }
  ]
}
```

Perry's codegen translates the user's TS-side calls
(`mysql.createConnection(config)`, `c.query(sql, params)`) into direct
calls to these symbols, with the right argument coercion (JsValue
NaN-box ↔ f64 ABI shim, string-pointer extraction, etc.).

### 4. Linking

The staticlib (`libperry_ext_mysql2.a` for the well-known case, or a
prebuilt artifact in `node_modules/mysql2/prebuilt/<target>/` for the
external case) joins the link line alongside `libperry_runtime.a` and
`libperry_stdlib.a`. The `js_mysql2_*` symbol references in the
user's compiled code resolve at link time.

If the binding ships only Rust source (no prebuilt), Perry runs
`cargo build --release` on the wrapper at compile time. Slow first
build, then cached.

### 5. Runtime

User code runs. Calls into `js_mysql2_*` happen at native speed —
function call overhead is one register-pass for the receiver handle
plus one each per param. Promise resolution / closure invocation /
async work bridge through perry-ffi's surface (`JsPromise`,
`JsClosure`, `spawn_blocking + tokio::Handle::current().block_on`).
The wrapper sees Perry's NaN-boxed JsValues directly; user TypeScript
sees a normal Promise / object / array.

## What perry-ffi guarantees

The 9 surface dimensions perry-ffi exposes today are:

| Surface | What it does | Documented at |
|---|---|---|
| Strings | `JsString` / `alloc_string` / `read_string` / `read_bytes` / `alloc_bytes` | [`abi.md`](abi.md) |
| Async / Promise | `JsPromise` (`new` / `resolve` / `reject_string`), `spawn_blocking` | [`abi.md`](abi.md) |
| Handles | `register_handle` / `get_handle` / `with_handle` / `take_handle` / `iter_handles_of` | [`abi.md`](abi.md) |
| JsValue + objects/arrays | `JsValue`, `js_array_alloc/push/get/set`, `js_object_alloc_with_shape`, `js_object_get_field`, `js_object_set_field`, `build_object_shape` | [`abi.md`](abi.md) |
| Closures | `JsClosure::call0..4` | [`abi.md`](abi.md) |
| GC root scanner | `gc_register_root_scanner` | [`abi.md`](abi.md) |
| BigInt | `BigIntHeader`, `alloc_bigint_from_str`, `read_bigint_limbs` | [`abi.md`](abi.md) |
| Buffer | `BufferHeader`, `alloc_buffer`, `read_buffer_bytes` | [`abi.md`](abi.md) |
| JSON-stringify | `json_stringify(JsValue) -> Option<String>` | [`abi.md`](abi.md) |
| Event pump | `notify_main_thread` | [`abi.md`](abi.md) |

A wrapper that uses anything outside this list (e.g. reaches into
`perry_runtime::*` types directly) is **off-contract** — its build
will break the next time those types change. Stay on perry-ffi.

The [`abi.md`](abi.md) page is the source of truth for what's in each
surface. The semver promise: **breaking changes to anything documented
there bump perry-ffi major**, regardless of what `perry-runtime` does
internally.

## Code organization

```text
crates/
  perry-ffi/              ← Layer 2: the stable ABI surface
  perry-runtime/          ← Layer 1: NaN-boxing, GC, arena, JS objects
  perry-stdlib/           ← Layer 1: in-tree wrappers (perry/ui, fs,
                            crypto helpers, etc. — anything genuinely
                            coupled to runtime internals)
  perry-ext-<name>/       ← Layer 3, well-known: mysql2, pg, ioredis,
                            cron, decimal, dayjs, axios, ethers,
                            commander, … (~27 today). All depend on
                            perry-ffi only.

External native bindings (Layer 3, third-party — Rust + perry-ffi):
  PerryTS/tursodb-bindings    → bun add @perryts/tursodb
  PerryTS/iroh-bindings       → bun add @perryts/iroh
  <anyone>/whatever-bindings  → user publishes themselves

External pure-TypeScript drivers (compiled via compilePackages):
  PerryTS/postgres            → bun add @perryts/postgres
  PerryTS/mysql               → bun add @perryts/mysql
  PerryTS/mongodb             → bun add @perryts/mongodb
```

The split between **well-known** in-tree wrappers and **external** is
a packaging convention, not a technical distinction. Both depend only
on perry-ffi; both ship `extern "C"` symbols Perry's codegen calls.
The well-known set is the ~30 packages every JS dev expects to import
without an `npm install` step (`dotenv`, `axios`, `mysql2`, …).
External wrappers are everything else.

The two existing external native wrappers (`tursodb`, `iroh`) cover
functionality that doesn't have an in-tree perry-stdlib equivalent —
they're net-new bindings that originated as third-party packages.
That validates the contract: perry-ffi is sufficient to write a real
wrapper without forking Perry.

## Three paths to a database driver (postgres / mysql / mongodb)

Perry currently ships two parallel database-driver families. Picking
one is a packaging trade-off, not a feature trade-off:

| Path | Install | Resolver layer | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Well-known native binding** | nothing (bundled) | (c) | `import 'mysql2'` / `import 'pg'` / `import 'mongodb'` route to in-tree `perry-ext-mysql2` / `perry-ext-pg` / `perry-ext-mongodb`. Rust wrappers around `sqlx` / `mongodb` crates. Versioned in lockstep with Perry. |
| **`@perryts/{postgres,mysql,mongodb}`** | `bun add @perryts/postgres` | (a) | Pure-TypeScript wire-protocol drivers — no Rust, no native dep. Use Perry's [`compilePackages`](../packages/porting.md) to compile the TS to native via LLVM. Also run unmodified on Node.js / Bun. Independent semver. |
| **External native binding** | `bun add @perryts/tursodb` | (a) | Third-party Rust crate using `perry-ffi`, manifest at `package.json::perry.nativeLibrary`. Today: `@perryts/tursodb`, `@perryts/iroh`. |

Resolution precedence (per layer (a) → (b) → (c) above): an installed
`@perryts/mysql` does **not** override `import 'mysql2'` because the
package names are different. If you `bun add @perryts/mysql` and also
`import 'mysql2'` in the same program, both drivers ship in the
binary — they're independent. To opt out of the well-known `mysql2`
shim, just don't import `mysql2`.

**When to pick which:**

- **Well-known native (`mysql2` / `pg` / `mongodb`)** — zero install
  step, fastest path to "it works"; you accept that the driver's
  feature set tracks Perry's release cadence.
- **`@perryts/postgres` / `@perryts/mysql` / `@perryts/mongodb`** —
  you want to read / fork / patch the driver in plain TypeScript;
  you want the same code running on Node.js or Bun for fallback;
  you need a feature ahead of Perry's next release.
- **External native binding** — you're wrapping a Rust crate that
  doesn't have a JS-only equivalent (Tursodb's embedded SQLite-
  compatible engine, Iroh's QUIC transport).

## Concrete how-tos

| If you want to … | Read |
|---|---|
| **Use `mysql2` / `dotenv` / etc. in a Perry program** | Nothing! `import` and go — Perry ships them in the well-known set. |
| **Use a third-party native binding** | `bun add <package>`, then `import`. Perry's resolver finds it via `node_modules/<pkg>/package.json`. |
| **Find which packages ship out-of-the-box** | `perry native list` |
| **Write your own native binding** | `perry native init my-bindings` scaffolds the Cargo crate + `package.json` + `release.yml` for prebuilds. Then read [`abi.md`](abi.md) for the perry-ffi surface and [`manifest-v1.md`](manifest-v1.md) for the manifest schema. |
| **Verify your binding's manifest matches its `.a`** | `cd my-bindings && perry native validate` (runs `cargo build --release`, walks `nm -gP` over the staticlib, diffs against `functions[]`, reports missing or undeclared symbols). |
| **Override a well-known binding** | Install your fork into `node_modules/<name>/` with a `perry.nativeLibrary` block. Resolution layer (a) wins over layer (c). |
| **See what stdlib APIs Perry implements** | Auto-generated from the manifest: [`docs/src/api/reference.md`](../api/reference.md). The `perry types` command writes a current snapshot to `.perry/types/stdlib/index.d.ts` for editor squiggles. |

## Authoring a binding — the 60-second tour

```sh
# Scaffold
perry native init my-pdf --description "PDF rendering bindings" \
  --upstream-dep 'pdfium-render = "0.8"'
cd my-pdf

# Edit src/lib.rs — add your `js_*` functions, all using only
# `perry_ffi::*` types
$EDITOR src/lib.rs

# Edit src/index.ts — declare the TS surface user code imports
$EDITOR src/index.ts

# Edit package.json — list every js_* export in the
# perry.nativeLibrary.functions[] block
$EDITOR package.json

# Verify
perry native validate
# ✅ manifest matches the staticlib

# Publish
git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags  # the scaffolded release.yml
                                    # builds prebuilts for all targets
                                    # and attaches them to the release
npm publish
```

A user can now `bun add my-pdf` and `import { renderPdf } from "my-pdf"`
in their Perry program.

## Versioning policy

- **`perry-ffi`** semver: tracks Perry's minor today (`perry-ffi = "0.5"`
  for Perry `0.5.x`). Backwards-incompatible changes to anything
  documented in [`abi.md`](abi.md) bump perry-ffi *major* —
  independent of `perry-runtime`. Wrappers depend on `perry-ffi = "0.5"`
  and stay buildable across Perry's `0.5.x` releases.
- **Manifest spec v1**: locked at `abiVersion: "0.5"`; missing field
  is warning-only in v0.5.x, hard error from v0.6.0. Schema changes
  bump the spec version (`v2`) and ship alongside a new manifest
  schema file.
- **Wrappers**: each ships independent semver; users `bun update` a
  binding without touching Perry.

## Consumption today (v0.5.x)

Until the v0.6.0 type-source-of-truth refactor lands, `perry-ffi` is
**not yet on crates.io**. External wrappers depend on it via git URL:

```toml
[dependencies]
perry-ffi = { git = "https://github.com/PerryTS/perry", branch = "main" }
```

`PerryTS/tursodb-bindings` and `PerryTS/iroh-bindings` use this shape
and `cargo build` against live `main`. The git-URL approach is the
**supported** consumption mechanism for the v0.5.x cycle; the v0.6.0
plan inverts type ownership so `perry-ffi` becomes the source of
truth and can publish to crates.io as `perry-ffi = "0.6"`.

## Limits

- Bindings are **build-time linked**. Perry doesn't `dlopen` plugins
  at runtime — the staticlib joins the link line, the binary stands
  on its own.
- Bindings can't bring their own JS runtime — they extend Perry's,
  not replace it. A binding that wants its own GC / event loop /
  threading is out of scope.
- Cross-target prebuilds are the binding author's responsibility.
  The scaffolded GitHub Actions workflow handles the common matrix
  (x86_64+aarch64 macOS/Linux + Windows); other targets need
  manual additions.
