//! Prototype comparison for `util.isDeepStrictEqual` / `assert.deepStrictEqual`
//! (issue #2934).
//!
//! Node's default deep-strict comparison is prototype-sensitive: two values
//! with identical own properties but different `[[Prototype]]` are NOT equal
//! (e.g. `{ x: 1 }` vs `Object.create(null)` with `x = 1`, or instances of two
//! different constructors). The shared helper used to fall back to formatting
//! the enumerable body, which dropped this distinction.
//!
//! `prototype_token` returns a comparable identity token for the operand's
//! prototype; the deep-equal helper short-circuits to `false` when two
//! heap-object operands have differing tokens before comparing their bodies.
