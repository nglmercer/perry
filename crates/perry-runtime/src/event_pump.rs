//! Main-thread event pump wakeup primitive (issue #84).
//!
//! Replaces the old hard `js_sleep_ms(10.0)` in the generated event loop
//! and the `js_sleep_ms(1.0)` busy-wait inside `await`. The main thread
//! blocks on a `Condvar` until either:
//!
//! - a cross-thread event source (tokio worker, `std::thread::spawn`)
//!   calls `js_notify_main_thread` after pushing into a queue that the
//!   pump drains, or
//! - the next timer / interval deadline elapses, or
//! - a 1-second safety cap elapses (heartbeat).
//!
//! Result: cross-thread async-op latency on the event loop drops from
//! ~5 ms average (half of the old 10 ms quantum) to single-digit
//! microseconds — limited only by `Condvar::wait_timeout` wake latency.
//!
//! Producer/consumer protocol:
//!   producer (any thread):  push_to_queue();  js_notify_main_thread();
//!   consumer (main thread): drain_queues();   js_wait_for_event();
//!
//! The flag is what makes a notify sent **before** the consumer enters
//! `wait_timeout` survive — if we used a bare `Condvar::wait_timeout`
//! without a flag we would lose any notify that races the lock acquire.

// instantly instead of polling. The callback runs on whatever thread called
// `js_notify_main_thread` (any tokio worker, any std::thread::spawn), so the
// host's implementation must be thread-safe — typical use is
// `EventLoopProxy::send_event(())` which is.
