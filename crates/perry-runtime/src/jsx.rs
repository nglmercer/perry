//! JSX runtime adapter (`js_jsx` / `js_jsxs`).
//!
//! These intercept the SWC JSX-transform's `(type, props)` calls and
//! dispatch:
//!
//! - **User function components**: when `type` is a callable closure
//!   (NaN-boxed POINTER to a `ClosureHeader`), we call it with `props`
//!   as the single argument. This is what makes `<App />` work for
//!   user-defined `function App(props) { … }` components.
//! - **Fragment marker**: when `type` is the inline `"__Fragment"`
//!   string, we return `props.children` directly (the SWC transform
//!   already collected fragment children into the `children` field).
//! - **Everything else**: returns `TAG_UNDEFINED` — including JSX
//!   pointing at built-in intrinsics like `<Box>` / `<Text>` from
//!   `perry/tui`. Those are reachable through the JSX runtime only
//!   after the per-intrinsic compile-time rewriter lands (#679 Phase 2
//!   follow-up). Until then, use the function-call form `Box([...])` /
//!   `Text("…")` for `perry/tui` widgets.
//!
//! # ABI note
//! The codegen in `lower_call.rs` routes `ExternFuncRef { name: "jsx" }` and
//! `"jsxs"` through a dedicated arm that passes ALL arguments as `double`
//! (NaN-boxed), bypassing the string→PTR conversion that the generic
//! ExternFuncRef path would apply to string literals. Both adapters
//! therefore take `(f64, f64) -> f64`. When more args are added in
//! future (e.g. the optional `key` parameter from the React 17+
//! transform) the arm and the adapters should be updated together.
