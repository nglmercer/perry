//! HIR-level static-trip-count for-loop full-unroll pass.
//!
//! Detects the canonical small-fixed-trip-count for-loop shape:
//!
//! ```text
//! for (let i = LO; i {<,<=} HI; i++) { body }
//! ```
//!
//! where `LO` and `HI` are integer literals and the resulting trip count is
//! small (≤ `MAX_TRIP_COUNT`). Replaces the entire `Stmt::For` with N copies
//! of the body, with every `Expr::LocalGet(i)` substituted by
//! `Expr::Integer(LO + n)` for the n-th copy.
//!
//! Motivation — `image_convolution`'s 5×5 blur kernel:
//!
//! ```text
//! for (let ky = -2; ky <= 2; ky++) {
//!   const krow = KERNEL[ky + 2];
//!   for (let kx = -2; kx <= 2; kx++) {
//!     const k = krow[kx + 2];
//!     rAcc += src[idx] * k;
//!     ...
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! With the kx loop unrolled (`kx` substituted with -2, -1, 0, 1, 2), the
//! `KERNEL[ky + 2][kx + 2]` access folds to `KERNEL[ky + 2][0..4]`. With
//! the ky loop also unrolled, both indices are compile-time integers and
//! Perry's existing flat-const machinery (`Expr::IndexGet` on a flat
//! `[25 x i32]` global with literal indices) replaces the load with a
//! constant. LLVM then specializes mul-by-1 to no-op, mul-by-4 to a
//! 2-bit shift, and mul-by-16 to a 4-bit shift — matching Zig's
//! ~130 ms scalar blur kernel instead of Perry's SIMD-bound ~240 ms.
//!
//! ## Safety guards (rejected shapes)
//!
//! Bodies that contain any of the following are NOT unrolled. Each shape
//! has a specific reason it can't be safely unrolled by N-copy substitution:
//!
//! - **`break` / `continue` / labeled break/continue** — would need to be
//!   rewritten as `LabeledBreak` to a synthetic label wrapping the
//!   unrolled stmts. Out of scope for v1.
//! - **`Stmt::Labeled`** — same reason; the label is loop-scoped and
//!   would alias with siblings post-unroll.
//! - **Closures capturing the IV** — each iteration needs to capture a
//!   different value of `i`, but unrolling produces stmts at the caller
//!   scope where `i` no longer exists. Substituting `LocalGet(i)` to
//!   `Integer(N)` inside the closure body works only for closures that
//!   capture-by-value at construction time AND aren't called after the
//!   IV's loop-scope ends. Conservative: reject all closures referencing
//!   the IV.
//! - **`LocalSet(i, ...)` or `Update { id: i }` inside body** — user is
//!   manually mutating the IV; unrolling would lose those writes.
//!   Allowed only in the for-loop's own `update` slot (by definition).
//! - **Nested `Stmt::For` shadowing the same IV id** — can't happen if
//!   HIR has unique LocalIds (which it should), but the analysis bails
//!   defensively.
//! - **`Stmt::Try`** — `try { for {...} }` is fine, but `for { try {...} }`
//!   would need each unrolled iteration to share the same `catch` /
//!   `finally`. Conservative: reject.
//!
//! ## Trip count bound
//!
//! `MAX_TRIP_COUNT = 8`. Image_convolution's kernels are 5 trips each;
//! at 5×5 = 25 total inlined stmts per pixel and ~150 byte body per
//! statement, the unrolled module init is bounded at ~5KB extra IR per
//! kernel-bearing function. Larger trips would inflate code size faster
//! than LLVM constant-folding can claw back.
