//! Inline `finally` bodies before each abrupt completion that would
//! escape an enclosing `try { ... } finally { ... }`.
//!
//! ECMAScript spec: any `return` / `break` / `continue` (labeled or
//! unlabeled) that escapes a try body must run the corresponding
//! `finally` body before the abrupt completion takes effect. Pre-fix
//! Perry's codegen `Stmt::Return` lowering pop'd open try frames via
//! `js_try_end` and emitted `ret` directly, never running the `finally`
//! body; the same shape of bug applies to `Stmt::Break` / `Continue` /
//! `LabeledBreak` / `LabeledContinue` (the abrupt-completion stmt
//! terminates the basic block before the `br finally_label` is emitted).
//! The async-to-generator transform additionally flattens the try body
//! into a sequence of states with the finally body pushed AFTER the
//! body — but an abrupt completion in the body terminates the state
//! before the appended finally runs.
//!
//! This pass desugars at the HIR level, BEFORE async/generator transforms:
//!
//!   try { ...; return X; ... } finally { Y }
//!     →
//!   try { ...; let __ret = X; Y_clone; return __ret; ... } finally { Y }
//!
//!   for (...) {
//!     try { ...; if (cond) break; ... } finally { Y }
//!   }
//!     →
//!   for (...) {
//!     try { ...; if (cond) { Y_clone; break; } ... } finally { Y }
//!   }
//!
//! The `return` operand is hoisted into a fresh `let` so it evaluates
//! BEFORE the finally body — matching ECMAScript spec ordering (the
//! operand of `return` is evaluated, THEN finally runs, THEN the function
//! returns). Naïvely `Y_clone; return X` would inadvertently run Y before
//! X is evaluated, breaking the `return await foo()` pattern at the
//! heart of issue #536 (the await would suspend AFTER finally already
//! ran). `break` / `continue` have no operand so the prepend is direct.
//!
//! `return;` (no value) is rewritten as `Y_clone; return;` directly —
//! no hoist needed since there's no operand to evaluate.
//!
//! `break` / `continue` only inline finallies for trys that are INSIDE
//! the loop being escaped — finallies for OUTER trys (whose body
//! contains the loop, not the other way around) keep running through
//! the existing setjmp/longjmp path. The pass tracks `loop_depth` at
//! which each finally was pushed and runs only those whose
//! `loop_depth_at_push >= current_loop_depth_for_break`. Labeled
//! `break L` / `continue L` use the same comparison against the loop
//! depth recorded for the matching label.
//!
//! The original finally is preserved so non-abrupt-completion paths
//! still run it (and the throw path keeps using setjmp/longjmp through
//! `lower_try`). Each abrupt completion inside the body (or catch)
//! gets a clone of the innermost finally inlined immediately before
//! it. Nested try-with-finally stack the inlined clones
//! innermost→outermost.
//!
//! Limitations:
//!   - Code after the abrupt completion becomes dead — fine.
//!   - If `Y_clone` itself throws, the throw routes to the same try's
//!     catch (if any) instead of propagating directly. Per spec the
//!     throw should override the pending abrupt completion without
//!     going through the catch. Rare; matters only when the finally
//!     throws AND there's a same-level catch.
//!
//! Issue #536: `@perryts/mysql`'s `Pool.query` uses
//! `try { return await conn.query(...) } finally { this.release(conn) }`
//! — without this pass, `release` never runs, the connection stays
//! checked out, and `pool.end()` sees zero idle conns to close. Process
//! hangs because the underlying tokio socket task was never told to shut
//! down. The break/continue arms ride along (test_finally_break.ts and
//! similar shapes in user code that mix loop control with
//! resource-cleanup finallies).
