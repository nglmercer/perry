//! Async-runtime bridge for native bindings (added in v0.5.1 of
//! the perry-ffi v0.5 surface — non-breaking; pure additions).
//!
//! Many wrappers (bcrypt, argon2, ws, mysql2, …) need to do CPU-
//! bound or blocking work without stalling Perry's main thread.
//! perry-stdlib already runs a global tokio runtime + a
//! main-thread-pumped resolution queue for its own modules; this
//! module exposes that surface through a stable C ABI so external
//! wrappers can use the same runtime instead of spawning their
//! own (which would deadlock under contention).
//!
//! # Layered design
//!
//! 1. perry-stdlib provides `#[no_mangle] extern "C"` shims (see
//!    `crates/perry-stdlib/src/perry_ffi_async.rs`).
//! 2. This module declares those symbols `extern "C"` and exposes
//!    safe Rust wrappers — [`JsPromise`] and [`spawn_blocking`].
//! 3. External wrappers depend only on perry-ffi. At link time,
//!    perry-stdlib's archive resolves the `perry_ffi_*` symbols.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - A `JsPromise` is owned by Perry's runtime arena from
//!   construction onwards. Once resolved or rejected, the
//!   underlying `Promise` is consumed by the awaiter.
//! - The "bits" passed to [`JsPromise::resolve_string`] /
//!   [`JsPromise::reject_string`] are NaN-boxed `JSValue`
//!   representations. The safe wrappers in this module produce
//!   the right bit pattern so wrapper authors don't need to know
//!   the tag values.
