//! Stable `extern "C"` shims that perry-ffi declares for use by
//! external native binding crates (#466 Phase 1 + 5).
//!
//! perry-ffi can't depend on perry-stdlib's internal Rust modules
//! (`crate::common::async_bridge::*`) because that would force every
//! external wrapper to take a workspace dep on perry-stdlib —
//! defeating the whole point of an ABI-stable surface. Instead, the
//! contract goes through C ABI:
//!
//! 1. perry-stdlib (this file) defines `#[no_mangle] extern "C"`
//!    shims wrapping `async_bridge`'s public Rust functions.
//! 2. perry-ffi declares those symbols as `extern "C"` and exposes
//!    safe Rust wrappers (`JsPromise`, `spawn_blocking`).
//! 3. External wrappers depend only on perry-ffi. At final link
//!    time, the `perry_ffi_*` undefined references they carry get
//!    resolved by perry-stdlib's archive — same mechanism as every
//!    other `_js_*` symbol that perry-stdlib exports today.
//!
//! Symbol naming uses the `perry_ffi_` prefix (vs. perry-stdlib's
//! existing `js_*`) so the contract is unambiguously bound to
//! perry-ffi's semver — not perry-stdlib's. A breaking change to
//! one of these signatures bumps perry-ffi major.
