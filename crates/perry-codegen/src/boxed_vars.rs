/// - We box on capture + any mutation, even if the mutation is in
///   unreachable code. That's safe (just slightly worse perf).
/// - We don't distinguish "mutated inside the closure" from "mutated
///   outside"; both imply boxing. Again, safe.
/// - Params are not boxed here because Stmt::Let handles box
///   allocation; params are handled separately at FnCtx setup time
